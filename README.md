# Anime-Game
A web application that allows a user to generate a random anime based on specifications such as genre, year, type, and popularity.
## Description
It is now implemented as a quiz game. The user gives their username and specifications(including difficulty), and then a 10 question quiz is generated with a final [scoreboard](#####scoreboard).

### Features
There are a few features that give users the chance to input specifications before beginning the game.

#### Specifications

##### Genres
A list of genres that the user can select from.
##### Type
The user can either select "Anime" or "Manga"
##### Difficulty
The choice among "Normal," "Expert," and "Master"
#### Username
A username can be inputted to show up later on the scoreboard
#### Years
The user chooses years  per decade, ranging from the 1970's to the 2010's to delineate which years of anime or manga they know the best.

#### Game

##### Quiz

The user will be shown a picture or a description of an anime or manga based on their specifications. They will also be shown 4 multiple choice buttons, with names of anime or manga on them. The user then chooses the answer that they think is correct. This occurs 10 times.

##### Scoreboard
A list of the names of previous players and their scores including the current player.

## Roadmap
Using the core anime randomizing functionality, I plan to transform the project by adding social networking aspects to create an anime "book club".

Users would be able to log in and create and account. They would specify their preferences in anime or manga as well as the dates they are available and given a list of groups that matched their preferences. The user would then choose a group.

At the beginning of every month each group is randomly assigned an anime based on their preferences and the group members would have access to their own built-in forum where they could discuss what they are watching or reading in an organized fashion.

Each show will be broken up into episodes per week for that month, and the users would discuss what they watched on a specified day of their collective choosing.
